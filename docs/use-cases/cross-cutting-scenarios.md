# Cross-Cutting Scenarios

> Complex workflows that combine multiple use case patterns from Exploration, Creation, and Knowledge Management.

---

## 4.1 Research Project

**Goal**: Conduct a structured investigation into a model behavior or capability.

**Flow**:
1. User creates a Document outlining research questions
2. User creates multiple Loom Trees to explore different aspects
3. User uses [Branching Exploration](./exploration-study.md#11-branching-exploration) and [Comparative Model Study](./exploration-study.md#12-comparative-model-study) patterns
4. User documents findings via [Behavioral Documentation](./exploration-study.md#14-behavioral-documentation)
5. User links everything together in the Grove
6. User synthesizes a final report Document with Links to supporting evidence
7. User exports for publication or sharing

**Patterns Combined**:
- Exploration & Study (1.1, 1.2, 1.4)
- Knowledge Management (3.1, 3.2, 3.3)

**Value**: Full research workflow in one environment — exploration, documentation, synthesis, export.

## 4.2 Long-Form Writing Project

**Goal**: Write a substantial piece (article, story, essay) with model collaboration.

**Flow**:
1. User creates a Document for outline and notes
2. User creates a Loom in Buffer Mode for drafting
3. User uses [Buffer Mode Writing](./creation-collaboration.md#21-buffer-mode-writing) to explore directions
4. User uses [Iterative Refinement](./creation-collaboration.md#23-iterative-refinement) to improve sections
5. User links outline Document to relevant Loom branches
6. User exports final Path as polished document

**Patterns Combined**:
- Creation & Collaboration (2.1, 2.3)
- Knowledge Management (3.1, 3.3)

**Value**: The messy, non-linear process of writing is preserved and navigable. The final output is clean.

## 4.3 Model Onboarding

**Goal**: Get to know a new model's personality and capabilities.

**Flow**:
1. User adds a new Model to their Grove
2. User creates an Agent backed by the new Model
3. User runs through a personal "interview" Loom Tree — standard questions they ask every model
4. User generates multiple Continuations to see response variance
5. User compares to other models' interviews ([Comparative Model Study](./exploration-study.md#12-comparative-model-study))
6. User documents first impressions ([Behavioral Documentation](./exploration-study.md#14-behavioral-documentation))
7. User references Field Guide for model-specific considerations

**Voice Mode variant**: User conducts the interview hands-free while on a walk. Toggle Voice Mode on, ask questions verbally, listen to responses, double-tap interesting nodes to replay them later. A relaxed way to get acquainted with a new model.

**Patterns Combined**:
- Exploration & Study (1.1, 1.2, 1.4)
- Knowledge Management (3.4)

**Value**: Intentional relationship-building with models. Users develop informed preferences rather than defaulting to whatever's hyped.

## Scenario Comparison

| Scenario | Primary Goal | Key Patterns | Output |
|----------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Research Project | Investigate model behavior | Exploration + Documentation | Research report |
| Long-Form Writing | Create substantial content | Buffer Mode + Refinement | Polished document |
