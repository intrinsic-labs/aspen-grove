# Up To Date Goals & Vision for Aspen Grove

I am trying to clarify what this app is and who it is for. Primarily it is for me lol. Off the cuff, here's what comes to mind as far as what I want to get out of it:

1. File creator, editor, and manager that feels like the Zed IDE. Light, easy to move around, great for any sort of text file/notes/wikis.
2. Internal document linking like in Notion or Obsidian. 
3. LLM interactions are files in the file structure, alongside all your other notes and docs.
4. There are two LLM interaction modes: chat and text buffer. both take place as loom trees (branching exchange stored as hypergraph).
5. Loom trees can be annotated, linked to notes at the tree or node level, examined by both humans and models alike, exported and shared, nodes can be bookmarked, edited, rearranged, etc. all the features you would want for maniuplating the tree space
6. Field guide that explains how to think about LLMs in this multiversal way and how to prompt them properly
7. pure JS apps that run in a JS runtime (like JSCore or the new WebPage JS api) - like the artifacts on Claude.ai but working as a small js app. idk if this is useful or not but it would be sick
