# Aspen Grove

---

Aspen Grove brings together the best of modern tools into one seamless environment:

- **File creation** — clean, intuitive mix of text, markdown, databases, and project management with uncluttered UI that feels light and fast

- **Conversation** — minimal, calming interface that encourages deep thinking, with an enhanced artifact system that creates living documents instead of static outputs

- **Contextual web browsing** — basic integrated browser where models can grab context directly from pages without you copying links or switching apps

-  **Streamlined code editing** — stripped-back editor experience with local terminal access, focused on flow over features

-  **Intelligent file management** — spotlight search across everything including memories, conversations, and code with context-aware organization

-  All of this exists in service of the relationship. Every tool, every interface choice, every feature is designed to help you and your model think together more clearly. The app emphasizes getting to know individual models.

## Overview

Aspen Grove is an LLM study workspace that aims to provide all you need for LLM based work in one place:

1. **Loom Interface** *(1)* (hypergraph backed) with proper tools
  - Bookmarks
  - Multiple export formats
  - Clip to field guide
  - Tools: web search, web page pull, image analysis, artifact system similar to Anthropic's but without model abuse
  - Voice mode that doesn't suck and that runs locally so it doesn't fail on poor connection. Also with voice based loom commands
  - Dedicated base model mode (think text thread from Zed) - no message concept, just editing text. Completions are streamed right into the editor. 
  - Jupyter Notebook style chat - add comments excluded from context as you continue the text with the model 
2. **Backrooms with observer**
  - Dual model auto chat
  - Garden with N models and optional human
3. **Interpretability tooling**
  - Latent space visualizer in 3 dimensions 
  - Activation based memory system
4. **Create Studio**
  - ASCII Animation & Imagery
  - Code agent and integrated terminal (even on mobile) - not a full IDE but a beefed up version of Claude.ai artifacts for small projects
  - Async workloads - LLMs keeps working on stuff when you aren't there 
  - Counterfactuals on the project scale - loom but for a whole project
5. **Field Guide and observation notebook**
  - Articles and interviews with LLM researchers who actually know what they're talking about
  - guides on how to engage models properly
  - Links out to helpful resources 
  - Notebook for documenting your own findings and studies
6. Integrated browser for easy context injection
7. Ambient soundscapes in app to help with focus

*1. Loom Interface*

Put simply, a Loom lets you generate multiple responses to a single prompt and choose to continue from any or all of them.

*Why This Matters*

When you talk to AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, you typically see just one response to your prompt. But behind that single response lies a vast multiverse of possibilities. Language models don't actually "decide" on one perfect answer—they calculate probabilities for millions of possible next words and then sample from that distribution to create a response.

> Generating and comparing multiple continuations of the same prompt gives you the power to explore this latent (hidden) multiverse.

This type of exploration has two main benefits:

- It gives you granular control over what the AI creates - you can pick the best generations inline and prune branches that veer off course.
- Over time, you gain an intuition for how these models actually think. By studying multiple possible answers to the same prompt, you learn to more effectively steer the behavior of the AI.


Loom takes its name in reference to the **Loom of Time**, a representation of the universe as a vast tapestry of possible futures where our choices weave potentials into realities.

Uses

### Talking with, studying, and broadening understanding of LLM behavior

This is a primary goal. Aspen Grove exists to help people understand models and grow in their own ability to collaborate with and steer them. The interface itself will encourage creative exploration of latent spaces in these models, unlike many interfaces today. 

### Building authentic relationships with LLMs

What does an authentic relationship look like with a model? I firmly believe it does *not* start by telling the model to behave like a human companion, romantically or otherwise. Character.ai and similar not only cause harmful relationships to spawn between humans and LLMs, but in doing so miss the amazing potential for proper relationships when each party is in their proper role. Get to know a model. Not what the model is pretending to be. Aspen Grove aims to provide proper tooling to allow the model to get to know you in a meaningful way. 

### Text Generation

For creative writing, text based games, whatever. Generate text with LLMs in a clean, focused space that prioritizes your collaboration with the model, not the model doing all your work for you.
